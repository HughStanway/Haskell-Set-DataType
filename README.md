# Haskell-Set-DataType
Inplimented a new Set Datatype in Haskell to include all basic set operations. This include fromList and toList to convert between Haskell lists and the set datatype and set operations such as: equals, empty, singleton, insert, union, intersection, difference, member, cardinality, setmap, setfoldr, powerSet, cartesian product, partition and setfilter.

The Set type is implimented using self-balancing AVL binary trees to ensure that all set operations are time efficient.
